						<p>DATA is a trendy name nowadays.  Everywhere you go, people talk about big data,
						 data science...  We are becoming more interested in data, because data can be analyzed 
						 for insights that give us more information and lead to better decisions.
	 					 Out of all kinds of data, national level census data is more related to each of us,
						which is used to plan the provision of health care, education, employment, transport, etc.  
						</p>
						<p>My analyse of 2014 census data focuses on the relation among Lacks Health Insurance, Poverty, 
							Obesity, Median Household Income.  The combinaiton of these four categories are: Poverty vs.
							 Lacks Health Insurance, Poverty vs. Obesity, Median Household Income vs. Obesity, and Median
							  Household Income vs. Lacks Health Insurance.  The following is what census data tells us based on the chart.
						</p>
						<p>Poverty vs. Lacks Health Insurance</p>
							<p>The higher percentage of poverty among the states, the higher percentage of lacks health insurance.  
								Massachussets is an exception with 11.6% of poverty, only 4.6% of lacks health insurance.
							</p>
						<p>Poverty vs. Obesity</p>
							<p>The chart shows that obesity isn't that related to poverty.  The lowerest percentage of 
								obesity is 21.3% across the nation, that means, at least, there is an overweight one out of every five individuals.
							</p>
						<p>Median Household Income vs. Obesity</p>
							<p>Median Household income slightly has a relation with obesity.  For example, Mississippi's median household income is $39680, 
								its obesity percentage is 35.5%; Maryland's median household income is $73971, its obesity percentage is 29.6%.  
								 Overall, obesity is an big issue regardless of household income.
							</p>
						<p>Median Household Income vs. Lacks Health Insurance</p>
							<p>The higher of median household income, the lower of percentage of lacks health insurance.  Texas is an outlier, 
								with $53035 median household income and the highest 24.9% of lacks health insurance.
							</p>
						<p>The chart tells us that obesity is becoming a big social problem.  For our health, we should pay more 
							attention to our daily diet and should do more excises.  We should improve our health insurance system to cover 
							more people in poverty as well.  About health insurance, Massachussets is a very good example.
